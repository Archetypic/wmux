      Obstacles that I am facing today are: Comprehending C, becoming proficient GNU Emacs, learn Latin and Spanish, and setting up an email server. In the future, learning elisp, ruby, C++, and college. In the past: crontab, learning to read man pages, installing Exherbo GNU/Linux, patching dwm, and configuring ncmpcpp. I have learned to have less distress regarding these activities and just persist with them since this is the course mandating the least amount of effort.
