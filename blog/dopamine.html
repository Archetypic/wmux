    <h1>Dopamine</h1>
    <p>
      In today's society, the range of virtual entermainment possibilites surmount the human's counting capability.
      Netflix, HBO Max, Fortnite, and Call of Duty are a small number of examples of modern entertainment.
      I find that consuming these media, YouTube specifically, rapidly drains my energy and leaves me with a longing to continue to watch videos.
      To effectively counteract this, I have created an rss feed utilizing sfeed which allows me to select videos, in the form of downloaded videos, I truly wish to watch.
      This prevents me from excessively viewing other videos, as long as I honor this policy.

      An additional note: though other activities such as doing nothing may not be as "fun", they are wholesomely more delightful.
      Having "fun" is not mutually exclusive from activities such as cleaning or reading.
