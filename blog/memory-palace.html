    <p>
      The method I am currently learning for memorization purposes is the memory palace.
      The first palace will be Dark Souls III.
      Through the act of drawing the map layout both digitally and physically along with replaying the game; the specific layout of the game map will be forever engrained in my memory.
      The memory palace of Dark Souls III, also named Soloman's Wizardry Watch, will initally store birthdays and the work schedule.
      I do intend on memorizing books through the memory palace though when this proves to be ineffective, there are several other memory techniques that will be highly effective.
