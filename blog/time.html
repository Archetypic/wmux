    <p>
      People focus on the time appropriate a task rather then the appropriate action for the task.
      People focus on the quantitative rather than the qualitative.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is only through, first, the qualitative aspects that the quantivative exists.
      As opposed to deeply contemplating on the time appropriate for a task, apply the appropriate actions.
