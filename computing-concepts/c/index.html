    <h2>Takeways (literal) from Modern C</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Takeaway A</b> C and C++ are different: don't mix them, and don't mix them up.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway B</b> Don't panic.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.1.1</b> C is an imperative programming language.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.2.1</b> C is a compiled program.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.2.2</b> A correct C program is portable between different platforms.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.2.3</b> A C program should compile cleanly without warnings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Since C is compiled programming language, a compilier is required to translate theC text into binary code or an execuatable. Examples of compilers are gcc, clang, and c99.
