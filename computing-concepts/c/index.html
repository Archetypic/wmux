    <h1>Modern C</h1>
    
    <h2>Takeways (literal)</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Takeaway A</b> C and C++ are different: don't mix them, and don't mix them up.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway B</b> Don't panic.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.1.1</b> C is an imperative programming language.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.2.1</b> C is a compiled program.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.2.2</b> A correct C program is portable between different platforms.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.2.3</b> A C program should compile cleanly without warnings.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.1.1</b> Punctuation characters can be used with several different meanings.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.2.1</b> All identifiers in a program have to be declared.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.2.2</b> Identifiers may have several consistent declarations.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.2.3</b> Declarations are bound to the scope in which they appear.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.3.1</b> Declarations specify identifiers, whereas definitions specify objects.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.3.2</b> An object is defined at the same time it is initialized.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.3.3</b> Missing elements in intializers default to 0.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.3.4</b> For an array with <b>n</b> elements, the first element has index 0, and the last has index <b>n-1</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.3.5</b> Each object or function must have exactly one definition.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.4.1</b> Domain iterations should be coded with a <b>for</b> statement.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.4.2</b> The loop variable should be be defined in the initial part of a <b>for</b>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Since C is compiled programming language, a compilier is required to translate theC text into binary code or an execuatable.
      Examples of compilers are gcc, clang, and c99.
    </p>

    <h2>Punctuation in C</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Bracket: { ... }</li>
      <li>Bracket: ( ... )</li>
      <li>Bracket: [ ... ]</li>
      <li>Bracket: /* ... */</li>
      <li>Bracket: &lt ... &gt</li>
      <li>Terminator: ,</li>
      <li>Terminator: ;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Brackets are always paired. <code>/* ... */</code> is the comment sytax.
      Comments are ignored by the compiler.
      The fixed values in a program are known as literals.
      Indentifiers are names given to certain entities.
      i is an example of a data object or variable.
      <b>Type</b> specify "sort" of a new object, typically appended with <i>_t</i>.
      <b>main</b> and <b>printf</b> are functions.
      Constants, such as <b>EXIT_SUCCESS</b>.
      <b>main</b> must always be present, because it is the staring point of any program's execution.
      Operators in C can be utilized for initialization and assignment, comparison, increment and decrment a variable, and perform arithmetic on numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <b>declaration</b> specifies what the identifier represents.
      An <b>array</b> is an aggregate of several items of the same type.
      <b>Variables</b> are named items that store <b>values</b>.
      The <b>scope</b> is a part of the program where an identifier is <b>visible</b>.
      A <b>block scope</b> is delimited by a block such as <code>{ ... }</code>.
      A file scope is not delimited by <code>{ ... }</code> and its identifiers are referred to as <i>globals</i>.
      An <b>intialization</b> is a grammatical construct that augments a declaration and provides an initial value for the object.
      <b>Statements</b> are instructions that tell the compilier what to do with idenifiers that have been declared thus far.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within a for-statement, the code that is repeated is called the <b>loop body</b>; it is the <code>{ ... }</code> block that follows the <b>for</b> <code>( ... )</code>.
      Inside of the <code>( ... )</code> contains the declaration, definition, and initializer.
      The <b>loop condition</b>, <code> i &lt 5</code>, specifies the duration the <b>for</b> iteration should continue.
      It thus keeps iterating as long as i is less than 5.
      <code>++i</code> is executed after each iteration.
      It increases the value of i by 1 each iteration.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Function calls</b> are special statements that suspend the execution of the current function and then hand over control to the named function.
      <b>Function return</b> tells <b>main</b> function to return to the statement that it was called from once it's done.
