    <h1>Modern C</h1>
    
    <h2>Takeways (literal)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Takeaway A</b> C and C++ are different: don't mix them, and don't mix them up.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway B</b> Don't panic.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.1.1</b> C is an imperative programming language.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.2.1</b> C is a compiled program.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.2.2</b> A correct C program is portable between different platforms.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.1.2.3</b> A C program should compile cleanly without warnings.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.1.1</b> Punctuation characters can be used with several different meanings.</li>
      <li><b>Takeaway 0.2.2.1</b> All identifiers in a program have to be declared.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Since C is compiled programming language, a compilier is required to translate theC text into binary code or an execuatable. Examples of compilers are gcc, clang, and c99.

    <h2>Punctuation in C</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Bracket: { ... }</li>
      <li>Bracket: ( ... )</li>
      <li>Bracket: [ ... ]</li>
      <li>Bracket: /* ... */</li>
      <li>Bracket: &lt ... &gt</li>
      <li>Terminator: ,</li>
      <li>Terminator: ;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Brackets are always paired. <code>/* ... */</code> is the comment sytax.
      Comments are ignored by the compiler.
      The fixed values in a program are known as literals.
      Indentifiers are names given to certain entities.
      i is an example of a data object or variable.
      <b>Type</b> specify "sort" of a new object, typically appended with <i>_t</i>.
      <b>main</b> and <b>printf</b> are functions.
      Constants, such as <b>EXIT_SUCCESS</b>.
      <b>main</b> must always be present, because it is the staring point of any program's execution.
      Operators in C cab be utilized for initialization and assignment, comparison, increment and decrment a variable, and perform arithmetic on numbers.
