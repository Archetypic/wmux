    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      Tetyana Obukhanych claims that "vaccination is one of the most deceptive inventions the science could ever conceive the world to accept" and thus prevents modern humans from analyzing more thorougly natural immunity.
      Because the field of <em>immunology</em> only analyzes the "immune's system response to injected material", the dogma and foundation of this field is self-probiting; comparisons to natural immunity and how to acquire it are never diligently explored.
      The immunologists utilize labatory-grown microorgranisms in order to represent the infection.
      Since labatory-grown microorganisms and the natural diseases differ, their results are hampered due to these limitation.
      The temporary immunity provided by the vaccine proves that this is an ineffective prophylatic method.
      <br> Narrator states three facts that contributed to her "gradual disillusionment" of vaccines.
      <ol>
	<li>Signicant inconsistencies with immunologic paradigms and their appications - vaccines. </li>
	<li>Narrator observed some seasoned immunologists omitting the outcome of crucial experiments to make their publication on new vaccine development strategies look very promising.</li>
	<li>The birth of her child.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
      <ul>
	<li><blockquote>"I have realized that the invention of vaccination in the 18th century has precluded us from seeking acquired immunity to diseases really is."</blockquote>
	<li><blockquote>"The biological term <em>immunity</em> refers to a universally observed phenonmenon of becoming unsusceptible to a number of infectious dieases through prior experience ... Immunology is a science that primarily studies an artificial process of <em>immunization</em> - i.e, the immune system's response to injected foreign material. Immunology does not attempt to study and therefore cannot provide understanding of natural diseases and immunity that follows them.</blockquote>
	<li><q>Because immunologic experiments are unrealistic simulations of the natural process, immunologists' understanding of nature is limited to understanding their own experimental models.</q></li>

      <h2>1. How We Got Married to the Idea of Vaccination</h2>

    <p>
      Originates from <em>variolation</em>.
      Edward Jenner standardized vaccinations after he injected subjects with a cowpox pustule and prematurely declared, as a result of his vaccination, and convinced British authorities to adopt vaccinations.
      Mr. Jenner did not test his vaccination against the naturally occuring smallpox but pus from a smallpox pustule.
      Through his inactions, he was not able to discover that the protection from the vaccine merely postpones a person's susceptibility to smallpox.
    </p>

    <h2>Quotes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><q>He tested his vaccinated subjects only for their resistance to variolation.
	  He did not test them for their resistance to natural smallpox.
	  Had he done the latter, he would have discovered that the protection from natural smallpox conferred by his vaccine was wearing off, merely postponing a person's susceptibility to smallpox but not eliminating it for the good the way natural disease experience does.</q></li>
      <li><q>Because the limitations of the vaccination approach in disease prevention were so grossly overlooked, the first important lesson we failed to learn is that vaccination does not lead to permanent immunity.</q></li>
      <li><q>Every new generation of immunologists is initiated into this illusion and inadvertently takes immunologic research in the direction that is further and further away from understanding the true basis of naturally acquired immunity.</q></li>

    <h2>2. Horse Anti-serum Mystery</h2>

    <p>
      Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato utilized horse anti-serum for treating diphtheria and tetanus.
      The symptoms of these diseases are caused by toxins secreted under specific conditions, not the bacteria themselves.
      The serum, liquid component of blood, acquires anti-toxic properites within animals that has been innoculated with these toxins.
      This serum is them used to treat diphtheria or tetanus in humans.
      This serum, due to its animal host, is highly incompatible with humans.
      An immunologist, in 1924, discovered that if diptheria or tetanus toxins are treated with formaldehyde, the disease symptoms will not occur despite large doses.
      These formaldehyde-treated toxins are named <i>toxoids</i> and became the basis for the tetanus and diphteria vaccines.
      Immunologists believe that due to antibodies extensive binding capability to toxins and pathogents, some antibodies can <i>neutralize</i> the toxins which in turn prevents toxins from causing the symptoms of diphtheria or tetanus.
      In addition, antibodies to the toxins are indistinguishable from antibodies to the toxoids.
      There is no emperical evidence, however, that the original horse's anti-serum is dependent upon toxin-binding antibodies.
    </p>

    <h2>Quotes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<q>
	  The original method of anti-serum production for therapeutic use involved animals.
	  Large animals, such as horses, were initially injected with a fraction of a lethal dose of the diphtheria or tetanus toxin.
	  The toxin dose was gradually increased with each subsequent injection...
	  Then their serum was collected and used as a treatment of diphtheria or tetanus in humans.
	</q>
      </li>
            
      <li>
	<q>
	  Animal serum was not well tolerated by many humans.
	  It frequently generated serious side effects called serum sickness in the recipients.
	  It became imperative to switch to anti-serum of human origin...
	</q>
      </li>
      
      <li>
	<q>
	  In 1924, a lucky immunologist found a solution.
	  It was discovered that if the diphtheria or tetanus toxins were treated with formaldehyde (a chemical crosslinking agent),
	  they would not cause the disease symptoms even if injected in large doses at once.
	</q>
      </li>
      
      <li>
	<q>
	  Immunologists attribute the anti-toxic effects of the von Behring-Kitasato's horse anti-serum therapy to molecular entities called antibodies (or immunoglobulins).
	</q>
      </li>
      
      <li>
	<q>
	  The supremecy of the antibody-centered dogma is so strong that anyone who dares to suggest testing it now would be viewed as a heretic.
	  I made this mistake myself by suggesting to one of my research advisors to let me test the antibody requirement.
	  I got yelled at and was told to keep my focus strictly on the "bread-and-butter" science.

    <h2>3. Natural Immunity to Tetanus - What a Surprise!</h2>

    <p>
      In the <i>Journal of Experimental Medicine</i>, edition during 1920s, is an analysis of C. <i>tetani</i>, the aneroibic bacteria which produces the tetanus toxin.
      After contact with oxygen, it becomes resilient and long-lived spores.
      These spores, with the catalyzying agent oxygen, germinate into bacterial cells capable of toxin porduction.
      By feeding guinea pigs with food containing C. <i>tetani</i> spores, these animals were naturally immune to the specific strain of tetanus.
      Following six months of this diet, the guinea pigs developed natural antibodies (<i>agglutinins</i>).
      It is also found that humans can harbor C. <i>tetani</i> spores in their stool without succumbing to tetanus.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><q>Until the age of digitization, however, these publications were collecting dust in the basements of medical schools, and there was no practical way of locating them.</q></li>
      <li><q>There are many different <i>C. tetani</i> strains, but they all produce the same type of toxin called tetanospasmin.</q></li>
      <li>
	<q>
	  <i>C. tetani</i> bacteria normally live in animal manure and intestines without causing the tetanus disease.
	  <i>C. tetani</i> bacteria require anaerobic conditions to be active ...
	</q>
      </li>
      <li><q>The rist of tetanus comes primarily from deep wounds that have been contaminated with <i>C. tetani</i> spores or bacteria.</q></li>
      <li>
	<q>
	  In the experiments documented in the 1920s, researches were able to establish the state of tetanus immunity in guinea pigs such that even after purposefully introducing tetanus spores into poorly maintained wounds, immune animals did not develop tetanus symptoms, while control animals did.
	  Natural immunity from tetanus was establised simply by feeding the animals food containing <i>C. tetani</i> spores.
	  Natural immunity, however, was strain-specific...
	</q>
      </li>
      <li><q>After having <i>C. tetani</i> spores in their diet for six months, animals developed natural antibodies to these spores (<i>agglutinins</i>) and some animals also developed anti-toxin antibodies.</q></li>
      <li>
	<q>
	  Because this important line of research on tetanus has for a long time disappeared from the radars of immunology, we failed to learn that natural immunity to tetanus is impossible.
	  Instead, we were left with a spurious idea that the toxoid-based vaccine is our only salvation.
	</q>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      How tetanus toxin debilitates its host:
      <ol>
	<li>The toxin tetanospasmin is produces from C. <i>tetani</i>.</li>
	<li>When it enters the central nervous system of its host, the activity of the neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) is inhibited. 
	<li>When this inhbition occurs, rigid muscular spasms, such as lockjaw, sardonic smile, and general convulusions follow.</li>
      </ol>

    </p>

    <h2>4. Double Standard of Scientific Scrutinity</h2>

    <p>
      The tetanus vaccine is not proven through randomized controlled trials.
      The reasons supporting is "success" are invalid at best.
      There have been tenatus victims, fully vaccinated.
      Intravaneous vitamin C was not recommended because the experiments involving it were not randomized.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<q>
	  How do we know that the tetanus toxoid vaccine currently in use is effective in tetanus prevention?
	  Actually, we do not know that...
	  Tetanus toxoid vaccine has not been subjected to an RCT [randomized controlled trials] to test its effectiveness in tetanus prevention.
	</q>
      </li>
      <li>
	<q>
	  During World War I, 70 unvaccinated U.S soldiers have contracted tetanus, which amounted to 13.4 cases per 100,000 wounds.
	  On the other hand, in World War II 12 U.S soldiers were reported to contract tetanus, which amounted to only 0.44 cases per 100,000 wounds...
	  any conclusion about the role of the tetanus vaccine in this reduction is scientifically invalid... we can reasonably speculate that the reduction in tetanus during WWII compared to the previous war was simply due to better wound hygiene or lower risk of <i>C. tetani</i> wound exposure.
	</q>
      </li>
      <li>
	<q>
	  In the civilian U.S. population, tetanus mortality has been dropping dramatically during the first half of the 20<sub>th</sub> century before the vaccine introduction, and it continue to drop further after the vaccine introduction.
	  Therefore the vaccine's role in tetanus reduction in the U.S population cannot be inferred from the tetanus mortality statistics either.
	</q>
      </li>
      <li>
	<q>
	  Finally, medical literature numerous case reports on tetanus victims (including fatal cases) who had been vaccinated and had high levels of presumably protective antibodies in the blood...
	  According to the dogma of the antibody-mediated protection against the toxin, these tetanus victims should have been protected by the antibody, but they were not. Explanation?
	</q>
      </li>
      <li>
	<q>
	  ... vitamin C was not recommended for introduction into standard medical practice for tetanus treatment.
	  Because the trial was not reported as randomized, it provided only preliminary evidence of vitamin C effectiveness in tetanus treatment.
	</q>
      </li>
      <li>
	<q>
	  The question, however, is why stringent requirements of evidence-based science have been applied to the safe, cheap, and non-profitable treatment, such as i.v. vitamin C administration, whereas the tetanus toxoid vaccine and TIG treatment have made it into the standard care for tetanus prevention and treatment bypassing any requirement of the modern evidence-based process.
	</q>
      </li>
      <li>
	<q>
	  But most often, vaccine effectiveness in disease prevention is inferred from its demonstrated efficacy in inducing antibody production and from the interpretation of the disease statistics after the vaccine is introduced into general population.
	  If the disease incidence goes down after the vaccine introduction, the vaccine takes credit.
	  If the disease incidence goes up after vaccine introduction ... well ... Then the conclusion is reached that the vaccine is effective, but simply needs to be given more often.
	</q>
      </li>
      <li>
	<q>
	  It is unethical and politically incorrect to demand that vaccine effectiveness in prevention of deadly diseases be established by an RCT.
	  But we might want to ask ourselves: is it ethical to approve a biologically invasive and clinically risky procedure, such as vaccination, without direct evidence for its effectiveness in disease prevention?  
	  Is it ethical to have a healthy baby with no imminent threat of contracting a rare deadly disease, risk undergoing an adverse vaccine  reaction, without even guaranteeing the protection from this disease in future?
	  Is it ethical to have a properly vaccinated person die from a disease the vaccine was intended for, but not proven to prevent?
	  Who accepts liability for such outcomes?
	</q>
      </li>
    </ul>
