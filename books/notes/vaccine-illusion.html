    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      Tetyana Obukhanych claims that "vaccination is one of the most deceptive inventions the science could ever conceive the world to accept" and thus prevents modern humans from analyzing more thorougly natural immunity.
      Because the field of <em>immunology</em> only analyzes the "immune's system response to injected material", the dogma and foundation of this field is self-probiting; comparisons to natural immunity and how to acquire it are never diligently explored.
      The immunologists utilize labatory-grown microorgranisms in order to represent the infection.
      Since labatory-grown microorganisms and the natural diseases differ, their results are hampered due to these limitation.
      The temporary immunity provided by the vaccine proves that this is an ineffective prophylatic method.
      <br> Narrator states three facts that contributed to her "gradual disillusionment" of vaccines.
      <ol>
	<li>Signicant inconsistencies with immunologic paradigms and their appications - vaccines. </li>
	<li>Narrator observed some seasoned immunologists omitting the outcome of crucial experiments to make their publication on new vaccine development strategies look very promising.</li>
	<li>The birth of her child.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
      <ul>
	<li><blockquote>"I have realized that the invention of vaccination in the 18th century has precluded us from seeking acquired immunity to diseases really is."</blockquote>
	<li><blockquote>"The biological term <em>immunity</em> refers to a universally observed phenonmenon of becoming unsusceptible to a number of infectious dieases through prior experience ... Immunology is a science that primarily studies an artificial process of <em>immunization</em> - i.e, the immune system's response to injected foreign material. Immunology does not attempt to study and therefore cannot provide understanding of natural diseases and immunity that follows them.</blockquote>
	<li><q>Because immunologic experiments are unrealistic simulations of the natural process, immunologists' understanding of nature is limited to understanding their own experimental models.</q></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1. How We Got Married to the Idea of Vaccination</h2>

    <p>
      Originates from <em>variolation</em>.
      Edward Jenner standardized vaccinations after he injected subjects with a cowpox pustule and prematurely declared, as a result of his vaccination, and convinced British authorities to adopt vaccinations.
      Mr. Jenner did not test his vaccination against the naturally occuring smallpox but pus from a smallpox pustule.
      Through his inactions, he was not able to discover that the protection from the vaccine merely postpones a person's susceptibility to smallpox.
    </p>

    <h2>Quotes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><q>He tested his vaccinated subjects only for their resistance to variolation.
	  He did not test them for their resistance to natural smallpox.
	  Had he done the latter, he would have discovered that the protection from natural smallpox conferred by his vaccine was wearing off, merely postponing a person's susceptibility to smallpox but not eliminating it for the good the way natural disease experience does.</q></li>
      <li><q>Because the limitations of the vaccination approach in disease prevention were so grossly overlooked, the first important lesson we failed to learn is that vaccination does not lead to permanent immunity.</q></li>
      <li><q>Every new generation of immunologists is initiated into this illusion and inadvertently takes immunologic research in the direction that is further and further away from understanding the true basis of naturally acquired immunity.</q></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Horse Anti-serum Mystery</h2>

    <p>
      Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato utilized horse anti-serum for treating diphtheria and tetanus.
      The symptoms of these diseases are caused by toxins secreted under specific conditions, not the bacteria themselves.
      The serum, liquid component of blood, acquires anti-toxic properites within animals that has been innoculated with these toxins.
