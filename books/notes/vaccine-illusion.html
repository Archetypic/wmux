<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
  Tetyana Obukhanych claims that "vaccination is one of the most deceptive inventions the science could ever conceive the world to accept" and thus prevents modern humans from analyzing more thorougly natural immunity. Because the field of <em>immunology</em> only analyzes the "immune's system response to injected material", the dogma and foundation of this field is self-probiting; comparisons to natural immunity and how to acquire it are never diligently explored. The immunologists utilize labatory-grown microorgranisms in order to represent the infection. Since labatory-grown microorganisms and the natural diseases differ, their results are hampered due to these limitation. The temporary immunity provided by the vaccine proves that this is an ineffective prophylatic method. <br> Narrator states three facts that contributed to her "gradual disillusionment" of vaccines.
  <ol>
    <li>Signicant inconsistencies with immunologic paradigms and their appications - vaccines. </li>
    <li>Narrator observed some seasoned immunologists omitting the outcome of crucial experiments to make their publication on new vaccine development strategies look very promising.</li>
    <li>The birth of her child.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Quotes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><blockquote>"I have realized that the invention of vaccination in the 18th century has precluded us from seeking acquired immunity to diseases really is."</blockquote>
    <li><blockquote>"The biological term <em>immunity</em> refers to a universally observed phenonmenon of becoming unsusceptible to a number of infectious dieases through prior experience ... Immunology is a science that primarily studies an artificial process of <em>immunization</em> - i.e, the immune system's response to injected foreign material. Immunology does not attempt to study and therefore cannot provide understanding of natural diseases and immunity that follows them.</blockquote>
